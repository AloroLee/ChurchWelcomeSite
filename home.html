            <strong>January: Who and What Are We?</strong>
            <p>We are as the body of Christ in 2019 has everything to do with the wisdom and sacrifices of those who
                came before us.
                Unfortunately, we often live as if the contemporary church were an island in time, cut off from the
                influence of the past
                and without regard for its impact on the future. So, join us this month as we learn the value of church
                history and explore our
                personal spiritual roots.</p>
